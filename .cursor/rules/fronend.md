# Frontend Rules

- Frontend is React.
- Use Class Components (NOT functional components).
- Do not suggest hooks like useState/useEffect.

- API calls should be abstracted into a service layer.
- Do not call fetch/axios directly inside UI logic.

- Keep state minimal and predictable.
- Use TypeScript.

- Follow clear folder structure:
  - pages/
  - components/
  - services/
  - models/
