# Backend Rules

- Backend is written in C#.
- Target framework: .NET Framework 4.8.
- Do NOT suggest migration to .NET 8.

- Use async/await when possible.
- Always return IActionResult from controllers.
- Validate models using DataAnnotations.

- Logging must be implemented.
- Use structured error handling.

- DTOs must be separated from Domain Models.
